## 📌 Project Overview

This repository showcases the work I completed during my **Data Analyst Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**.  
I used Python and data visualization libraries to perform **real-world data analysis**, focused on turning raw data into clear, actionable insights and visual stories.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

The project aimed to analyze structured business data to uncover patterns, trends, and inconsistencies.  
The goal was to clean and visualize data effectively and help answer practical business questions like:

- What are the top-performing categories or segments?
- Are there any hidden correlations or trends?
- Can we visually identify patterns that drive decision-making?

---

## 🛠️ What I Did

- 🧾 Collected and explored the dataset using Pandas
- 🧹 Cleaned data by handling missing/null values and formatting inconsistencies
- 🔍 Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- 📊 Created visuals like histograms, bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- 💡 Interpreted visual patterns to derive meaningful business insights
- 📸 Saved and documented visuals for reporting

---

## 📈 Sample Insights from the Analysis

- 📉 Identified data quality issues such as missing entries and duplicates
- 📊 Revealed top contributors in various performance categories
- 📈 Visualized monthly/quarterly performance trends
- 🧠 Found correlations between numerical fields (e.g., sales vs. customer age group)

## 📚 Dataset Information

The dataset provided by Cognifyz simulated real-world business data, including:

- Customer IDs
- Age groups
- Purchase categories
- Transaction timestamps
- Revenue and frequency metrics

This dataset required cleaning and restructuring before analysis, making it ideal for hands-on learning.
